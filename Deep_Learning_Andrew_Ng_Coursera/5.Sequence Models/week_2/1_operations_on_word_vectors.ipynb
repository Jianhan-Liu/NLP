    "To measure how similar two words are, we need a way to measure the degree of similarity between two embedding vectors for the two words. Given two vectors $u$ and $v$, cosine similarity is defined as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CosineSimilarity(u, v)} = \\frac {u . v} {||u||_2 ||v||_2} = cos(\\theta)Â \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u.v$ is the dot product (or inner product) of two vectors, $||u||_2$ is the norm (or length) of the vector $u$, and $\\theta$ is the angle between $u$ and $v$. This similarity depends on the angle between $u$ and $v$. If $u$ and $v$ are very similar, their cosine similarity will be close to 1; if they are dissimilar, the cosine similarity will take a smaller value. \n",
