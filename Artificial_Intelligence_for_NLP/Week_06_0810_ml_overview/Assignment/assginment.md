## 1.Summarize the reasons of overfitting and underfitting.
### 1.1.Some concepts
- bias: refers to how much we ignore the data
- variance: refers to how dependent our model is on the data
- Overfitting: too much reliance on the training data with low bias and high variance
- Underfitting: a failure to learn the relationships in the training data with high bias and low variance
- High variance: model changes significantly based on the training data
- High bias: assumptions about model lead to ignoring training data

### 1.2.Reasons for overfitting
- Complicated model with too much variables will cause overfitting
- Training data is far different from testing data
- Not enough training data

### 1.3.Reasons for underfitting
- Excessively simple model
- Not enough features

## 2.Writing down 3 sceneries that ML has been used now.
- Prediction: weather, game etc.What causes Underfitting
- Pattern recognition
- Machine translation
- Chat android
- Auto drive


## 3.Come out with 3 new sceneries with which ML may be applied.
- Migration learning to traditional industry
- Recognize emotion from voice
- Media language processing
